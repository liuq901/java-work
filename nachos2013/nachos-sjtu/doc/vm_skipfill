Purpose:
Test the virtual memory with some processes that each needs plenty of pages and may cause page fault frequently.

Usage:
-- nachos.ag.VMGrader -x vm_skipfill.coff -# coffPar0=xxx,coffPar1=xxx,coffPar2=xxx

History:
2008-12-26 Xiangru Chen: The first version.

Dependencies:
vm_skipfill_child.coff
	Store some value into memory, and load them later.
	This program may use plenty of pages and may cause page fault frequently.

Arguments:
coffPar0: the number of child processes that will be forked to run "vm_skipfill_child.coff".
coffPar1: the number of pages that each "vm_skipfill_child.coff" will use to store data.
coffPar2: the skip factor. It means that, only (PAGE_SIZE / (2 ^ "skip factor")) bytes in each page will be used. When the test seems too slow, increase this value to speed it up.

Sample:
-- nachos.ag.VMGrader -x vm_skipfill.coff -# coffPar0=5,coffPar1=32,coffPar2=4

Note: The fewer physical pages there are, the stricter and slower this test will be.
